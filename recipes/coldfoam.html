        <p>Cold foam is frothy, milk-based topping that's served over iced or cold brew coffee. It's different from steamed foam, as it's made by simply aerating milk with a frother or French press.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup skim milk or almond milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons vanilla simple syrup (see above) or purchased vanilla-flavored syrup (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups cold brew coffee or iced coffee</li>
            <li>freshly grated nutmeg or cinnamon (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk and simple syrup in a small measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Submerge the end of a milk frother in the mixture.</li>
            <li>Froth until consistently foamy, 15 to 20 seconds for skim milk or 2 to 3 minutes for almond milk.</li>
            <li>Divide cold brew coffee between 2 glass mugs.</li>
            <li>Spoon cold foam over coffee. Sprinkle with nutmeg or cinnamon.</li>
        </ol>
